This library provides convenient methods to work with the [CFTools Cloud](https://www.cftools.cloud) API from a nodejs/JavaScript project.

## Installation

Install via npm:

```sh
npm install cftools-sdk
```

## Usage

The main piece you will work with is the `CFToolsClient`.
It provides methods to interact with the API actions of CFTools Cloud and are documented in the corresponding interface.

Create a new instance of the client with the builder as shown in this example:

```typescript
import {CFToolsClientBuilder, SteamId64} from 'cftools-sdk';

const client = new CFToolsClientBuilder()
    .withServerApiId('your-server-api-id')
    .withCredentials('your-application-id', 'your-secret');

client.getPriorityQueue(SteamId64.of('a-steam-id')).then((item: PriorityQueueItem) => {
    // Do something
});
```

### API Reference

You can find the API reference for the SDK in [the documentation page](https://floriansw.github.io/cftools-sdk/).

### Caching

When using the SDK for a component that acts directly upon user interactions, consider that the CFTools Cloud API utilises a rate limit to protect for unusual load and abusive behaviour.
This SDK provides a way to circumvent a user issuing more requests to your program then the CFTools Cloud API allows you to do against a specific endpoint.
Enabling caching for the CFToolsClient will cache successful responses from the CFTools Cloud API with a provided Cache and will hold this information up to the configured expiration time.
The SDK ships with one Cache, which holds responses in-memory.

You can enable caching with the builder:

```typescript
import {CFToolsClientBuilder, SteamId64} from 'cftools-sdk';

const client = new CFToolsClientBuilder()
    .withCache()
    .withServerApiId('your-server-api-id')
    .withCredentials('your-application-id', 'your-secret');

client.getPriorityQueue(SteamId64.of('a-steam-id')).then((item: PriorityQueueItem) => {
    // Do something
});
```

Note, that mutable operations (like adding a priority queue entry) will never be cached.
